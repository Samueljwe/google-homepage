This project is simply building the google homepage (simple version with just a search box). First I need to set-upp the project repository. I will do this like so:
1. cd into the_odin_project
2. mkdir google-homepage
3. GO onto github.com and create a new repository called "google_homepage", then copy the SSH URL.
4. git clone git@github.com:Samueljwe/google-homepage.git
